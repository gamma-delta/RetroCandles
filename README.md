# Retro Candles

Adds powerful torches from Minecraft's past, reincarnated as candles.

The mod includes an (optional) Patchouli pamphlet detailing all the blocks and items!
But here's a quick summary:

- **Candlerino**, which speeds up time around itself
- **Interdiction Candle**, which prevents hostile mobs and projectiles from entering its radius
- **Sealing Wax**, which can be applied to candles to make them do a slightly different effect
